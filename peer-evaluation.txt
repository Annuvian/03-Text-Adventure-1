What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

That compared to their game mine was very boring.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

I liked the humor in it.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

The only small suggestion I would have is allowing for some more verbs or ways to word things, or at least
offer some like options from the player to pick from so at least have a small hint of what valid commands are.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

I don't think comments were necessary for this particular assignment

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

Nope, it all looked good and made sense and was well thought out and organized.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes it does.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 The README file looks good and is a good description of the game.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

The game was fun and entertaining. I liked the humor in it. Code was well written and functioned correctly.
